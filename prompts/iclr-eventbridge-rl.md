Create a publication-quality Figure 1 for a hypothetical ICLR paper titled "EventBridge-RL:
Uncertainty-Gated Dual-Timescale Imagination for Long-Horizon Reinforcement Learning." The figure
must use a 4:3 landscape aspect ratio, approximately 1600 × 1200 pixels, with a completely pure
white outer background. The overall visual language should resemble a polished modern ICLR method
overview: mathematically rigorous but visually engaging, combining clean scientific diagrams with
playful flat vector icons, thick near-black outlines, pastel yet moderately saturated colors,
compact mathematical notation, and a clear visual narrative. The result should look like a figure
created by machine learning researchers for the first page of a serious conference paper, not a
corporate infographic, not a presentation slide, and not a children's cartoon.

The central scientific idea is an RL agent that learns two complementary forms of imagination. It
performs fine-grained, step-by-step prediction near unfamiliar or uncertain transitions, while using
event-level temporal jumps when the future is predictable. The agent should segment a continuous
trajectory into meaningful events, construct both local and event-level world models, estimate
epistemic uncertainty, imagine several counterfactual futures, select a reliable trajectory, act in
the real environment, and update its policy through an event-structured replay buffer.

At the very top, place a long horizontal rounded rectangle spanning approximately 94% of the canvas
width. Use a white fill, a medium-thick powder-blue outline, and generous internal padding. Add a
small flat vector icon on the left showing a tiny robot explorer holding a compass or looking
through binoculars. Next to it, render the exact sentence:

“OBJECTIVE: Reach sparse, distant goals by jumping across predictable events and slowing down near
uncertain transitions.”

Use a scholarly serif typeface resembling Computer Modern or Times New Roman. "OBJECTIVE:" should be
bold, underlined, and slightly heavier than the rest of the sentence. Keep this banner visually
restrained and highly legible.

Below the objective banner, divide the canvas into one large method area occupying roughly
two-thirds of the width and one narrower counterfactual-planning area occupying roughly one-third.
Do not copy a circular environment taxonomy, HTTP architecture, browser interface, or server-client
diagram. Instead, construct a new composition based on temporal segmentation and branching futures.

The large left and central area should be enclosed in a softly rounded, very light warm-gray
container. Place the italicized bold heading "Event-Centric World Model" in its upper-left corner.
Inside this container, organize the method from left to right.

On the far left, show a short horizontal filmstrip labeled "Continuous Experience." The filmstrip
should contain five simplified environment frames with consistent black outlines. Depict a small
blue agent moving through a sparse-reward navigation environment: initially entering a room,
discovering a key, approaching a locked door, crossing a bridge, and seeing a distant golden goal.
These should be stylized vector scenes rather than screenshots. Beneath the frames, include compact
mathematical tokens such as:

o_t, a_t, o_{t+1}, a_{t+1}, …

Use alternating pale-blue observation cards and pale-yellow action cards. Add thin temporal arrows
between the cards. The cards should resemble mathematical trajectory tokens rather than interface
buttons.

Immediately to the right of the filmstrip, place an "Event Boundary Detector." Represent it as a
compact neural module with a bracket, segmentation marker, or scissors-like scientific icon, but
avoid making it overly cartoonish. Show vertical boundary lines splitting the filmstrip into
meaningful event groups. Above selected boundaries, place small probability labels b_t. Convert the
groups into three large event tokens:

e_1: Key Acquired

e_2: Door Opened

e_3: Goal Revealed

Represent each event token using a pale-yellow or pale-lavender rounded rectangle containing both a
small icon and a concise label. Draw a clean arrow from the continuous observations into these event
tokens. Add a small equation beneath the detector:

b_t = q_ψ(o_{t-k:t}, a_{t-k:t-1})

Keep the equation compact and correctly typeset.

In the center of the large container, split the flow into two parallel horizontal lanes. The upper
lane should be labeled "Local Dynamics" and use powder-blue modules. It should depict precise
one-step latent transitions:

z_t → z_{t+1} → z_{t+2}

Place the conditional model beneath this lane:

p_θ(z_{t+1} | z_t, a_t)

Use three small scene thumbnails to indicate detailed motion, contact, or obstacle avoidance. The
local lane should visually communicate careful, short-horizon reasoning.

The lower lane should be labeled "Event Dynamics" and use pale-yellow and lavender modules. Show
event-level temporal jumps:

e_j → e_{j+1} → e_{j+2}

Use elegant curved arrows that skip several intermediate frames. Annotate one curved arrow with Δt
and another with “skill c_j.” Place the event-level model beneath the lane:

p_ϕ(e_{j+1}, Δt | e_j, c_j)

Visually contrast the two lanes: the local lane contains several small consecutive states, while the
event lane contains fewer, larger semantic milestones connected by long arcs. Do not depict the
event-level model as simply another sequence of identical boxes.

At the convergence of the two lanes, place a distinctive diamond-shaped or rounded-switch module
labeled "Epistemic Gate." Give it a pale-coral outer region, a small uncertainty meter, and a
central pointer. The gate should receive uncertainty signals from both world-model branches. Include
the compact formula:

g_t = σ[κ(τ_u − U_t)]

From this gate, create two clearly labeled outputs. A lavender curved arrow should say "low
uncertainty: jump ahead" and connect to the event-level prediction. A powder-blue arrow should say
"high uncertainty: zoom in" and reconnect to the local dynamics lane. The design must make the
adaptive temporal-resolution mechanism immediately understandable without requiring a caption.

To the right of the gate, place a compact "Actor-Critic" module with a stylized policy network icon,
a small π_ω box, and a value box V_ξ. The actor receives the selected imagined state sequence and
outputs the real action a_t. Connect it to a small illustrated "Real Environment" containing the
agent, obstacles, a key, a door, and a goal. Use a solid blue-gray arrow for real interaction and a
return arrow carrying o_{t+1} back toward the continuous experience stream. Solid arrows must
indicate real environment interaction; dashed arrows must indicate imagined rollouts.

The narrower right-hand section should be titled "Counterfactual Futures." Do not use a circular
wheel. Instead, create a vertically oriented branching future tree beginning from one shared
current-state node. The current state should show the blue agent at a fork. From it, generate three
imagined branches using dashed arrows.

The first branch should be mint green and labeled "Accept." It should pass through a key and an open
door toward a golden goal. Add two small badges: "high return" and "low uncertainty."

The second branch should be pale yellow and labeled "Refine Locally." It should approach an
uncertain bridge or moving obstacle. Add a small magnifying-glass icon and a badge reading "request
local rollout."

The third branch should be pale coral and labeled "Reject." It should enter a foggy or visually
ambiguous region. Use a dotted boundary, an uncertainty cloud, and a small warning icon. Add the
labels "model disagreement" and "high risk."

At the bottom of this future tree, place a compact scoring equation inside a mint-bordered box:

S(τ) = R̂(τ) − λ_U U(τ) − λ_C C(τ)

Show a clear solid arrow from the accepted future back toward the Actor-Critic module. The three
branches should feel like scientific counterfactual planning rather than a decorative decision tree.

Across the bottom quarter of the entire figure, create a wide section labeled "Event Replay & Joint
Learning." Use a very pale cream or warm-yellow background with a thin rounded border. On the left,
show an event-structured replay trajectory as a horizontal sequence:

[o_t, a_t] → e_1 → [o_{t+k}, a_{t+k}] → e_2 → … → e_J

Alternate pale-blue observation groups, pale-yellow event groups, and small action tags. Use
vertical event-boundary markers and include one short segment highlighted with a lavender bracket
labeled "reusable skill segment." This should visually communicate that the replay buffer stores
both detailed transitions and semantic event chunks.

In the middle of the bottom section, include three enlarged example cards from one training episode.
The first card should depict the agent cautiously examining an uncertain bridge and include a small
text strip reading "high U_t → local prediction." The second should show the key acquisition event
and read "event boundary detected." The third should show a confident temporal jump toward the
opened door and read "low U_t → event jump." These cards must be illustrated environment states, not
photographic screenshots and not software interfaces.

To the right of the replay sequence, place a rounded lavender panel labeled “Joint Optimization.”
Inside, arrange four small white pill-shaped loss boxes:

L_dyn

L_event

L_unc

L_AC

Beneath them, show the combined objective:

L = L_dyn + αL_event + βL_unc + ηL_AC

Draw one broad blue-gray feedback arrow from the optimization panel upward to the world model and
another arrow toward the Actor-Critic. Avoid crossing arrows. Use curved routing where necessary.

At the far lower-right corner, add a small legend with three concise entries: a solid arrow labeled
"real transition," a dashed arrow labeled "imagined transition," and a dotted coral arrow labeled
"rejected future." Beneath or beside this legend, include four tiny domain icons in a single
restrained row: sparse-reward maze navigation, robotic manipulation, open-world crafting, and
adaptive locomotion. Do not create a large domain taxonomy; these icons should merely imply broad
applicability.

Use the following restrained but lively palette consistently: powder blue #BFD8F0 for observations
and local dynamics, butter yellow #FFE8A3 for events and actions, soft coral #F4C3BC for uncertainty
and rejected futures, lavender #DCC7EB for temporal jumps and reusable skills, mint green #C9E5C0
for accepted futures and positive outcomes, very light warm gray #F2F2F0 for major containers,
blue-gray #AAB8CC for structural arrows, and near-black #111111 for outlines and text. Colors should
be flat or almost flat, with no glossy effects and no strong gradients.

All icons must use consistent 2.5–3.2 pixel near-black outlines, rounded corners, simple geometric
construction, and controlled interior detail. Use minimal or no drop shadows. Maintain ample
pure-white negative space between the principal regions. Major arrows should be clearly visible but
not excessively thick. Mathematical symbols should be sharp, correctly formatted, and noticeably
smaller than the section headings.

Use bold serif headings, italic mathematical variables, and academically styled annotations. Avoid
modern corporate sans-serif typography for the main labels. Avoid giant acronyms, decorative
slogans, fake institutional logos, citation markers, benchmark scores, or unsupported numerical
performance claims. Do not include photorealistic robots, dark backgrounds, neon colors,
glassmorphism, dramatic 3D rendering, excessive gradients, microscopic text, cluttered arrow
intersections, or floating decorative elements unrelated to the method.

The complete figure should communicate one coherent story at a glance: continuous experience is
segmented into events; local and event-level models imagine at different temporal resolutions;
epistemic uncertainty determines whether to jump or zoom in; counterfactual futures are accepted,
refined, or rejected; the selected action is executed in the real environment; and event-structured
replay jointly improves the world model and the policy. Preserve a moderately dense ICLR Figure 1
aesthetic, but ensure that every component remains readable when the image is reduced to a
two-column paper width.
